eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000313.wav|We have repeated, in this brief note, all that is known of her designs for the story, which would have been completed in another chapter.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000314.wav|There is not so much to regret, then, so far as this novel is concerned;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000315.wav|indeed, the regrets of those who knew her are less for the loss of the novelist than of the woman - one of the kindest and wisest of her time.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000316.wav|But yet, for her own sake as a novelist alone, her untimely death is a matter for deep regret.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000317.wav|It is clear in this novel of Wives and Daughters, in the exquisite little story that preceded it, Cousin Phillis,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000318.wav|and in Sylvia's Lovers, that Missis Gaskell had within these five years started upon a new career with all the freshness of youth,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000319.wav|and with a mind which seemed to have put off its clay and to have been born again.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000320.wav|But that put off its clay must be taken in a very narrow sense.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000321.wav|All minds are tinctured more or less with the muddy vesture in which they are contained; but few minds ever showed less of base earth than Missis Gaskell's.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000322.wav|It was so at all times; but lately even the original slight tincture seemed to disappear.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000323.wav|While you read any one of the last three books we have named, you feel yourself caught out of an abominable wicked world,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000324.wav|crawling with selfishness and reeking with base passions, into one where there is much weakness, many mistakes,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000325.wav|sufferings long and bitter, but where it is possible for people to live calm and wholesome lives;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000326.wav|and, what is more, you feel that this is at least as real a world as the other.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000327.wav|The kindly spirit which thinks no ill looks out of her pages irradiate;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000328.wav|and while we read them, we breathe the purer intelligence which prefers to deal with emotions and passions which have a living root in minds within the pale of salvation,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000329.wav|and not with those which rot without it.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000330.wav|This spirit is more especially declared in Cousin Phillis and Wives and Daughters - their author's latest works;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000331.wav|they seem to show that for her the end of life was not descent amongst the clods of the valley, but ascent into the purer air of the heaven-aspiring hills.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000332.wav|We are saying nothing now of the merely intellectual qualities displayed in these later works.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000333.wav|Twenty years to come, that may be thought the more important question of the two;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000334.wav|in the presence of her grave we cannot think so; but it is true, all the same, that as mere works of art and observation,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000335.wav|these later novels of Missis Gaskell's are among the finest of our time.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000336.wav|There is a scene in Cousin Phyllis - where Holman, making hay with his men, ends the day with a psalm - which is not excelled as a picture in all modern fiction;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000337.wav|and the same may be said of that chapter of this last story in which Roger smokes a pipe with the Squire after the quarrel with Osborne.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000338.wav|There is little in either of these scenes, or in a score of others which succeed each other like gems in a cabinet, which the ordinary novel-maker could seize.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000339.wav|There is no material for him in half-a-dozen farming men singing hymns in a field, or a discontented old gentleman smoking tobacco with his son.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000340.wav|Still less could he avail himself of the miseries of a little girl sent to be happy in a fine house full of fine people;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000341.wav|but it is just in such things as these that true genius appears brightest and most unapproachable.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000342.wav|It is the same with the personages in Missis Gaskell's works.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000343.wav|Cynthia is one of the most difficult characters which have ever been attempted in our time.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000344.wav|Perfect art always obscures the difficulties it overcomes;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000345.wav|and it is not till we try to follow the processes by which such a character as the Tito of Romola is created,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000346.wav|for instance, that we begin to understand what a marvellous piece of work it is.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000347.wav|To be sure, Cynthia was not so difficult, nor is it nearly so great a creation as that splendid achievement of art and thought - of the rarest art, of the profoundest thought.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000348.wav|But she also belongs to the kind of characters which are conceived only in minds large, clear, harmonious and just,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000349.wav|and which can be portrayed fully and without flaw only by hands obedient to the finest motions of the mind.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000350.wav|Viewed in this light, Cynthia is a more important piece of work even than Molly, delicately as she is drawn, and true and harmonious as that picture is also.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000351.wav|And what we have said of Cynthia may be said with equal truth of Osborne Hamley.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000352.wav|The true delineation of a character like that is as fine a test of art as the painting of a foot or a hand, which also seems so easy, and in which perfection is most rare.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000353.wav|In this case the work is perfect. Missis Gaskell has drawn a dozen characters more striking than Osborne since she wrote Mary Barton,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000354.wav|but not one which shows more exquisite finish.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000355.wav|Another thing we may be permitted to notice, because it has a great and general significance.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000356.wav|It may be true that this is not exactly the place for criticism, but since we are writing of Osborne Hamley,
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000357.wav|we cannot resist pointing out a peculiar instance of the subtler conceptions which underlie all really considerable works.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000358.wav|Here are Osborne and Roger, two men who, in every particular that can be seized for description, are totally different creatures.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000359.wav|Body and mind they are quite unlike. They have different tastes;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000360.wav|they take different ways: they are men of two sorts which, in the society sense, never know each other;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000361.wav|and yet, never did brotherly blood run more manifest than in the veins of those two.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000362.wav|To make that manifest without allowing the effort to peep out for a single moment, would be a triumph of art;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000363.wav|but it is a touch beyond the reach of art to make their likeness in unlikeness so natural a thing that we no more wonder about it than we wonder at seeing the fruit and the bloom on the same bramble:
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000364.wav|we have always seen them there together in blackberry season, and do not wonder about it nor think about it at all.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000365.wav|Inferior writers, even some writers who are highly accounted, would have revelled in the contrast, persuaded that they were doing a fine anatomical dramatic thing by bringing it out at every opportunity.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000366.wav|To the author of Wives and Daughters this sort of anatomy was mere dislocation.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000367.wav|She began by having the people of her story born in the usual way, and not built up like the Frankenstein monster;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000368.wav|and thus when Squire Hamley took a wife, it was then provided that his two boys should be as naturally one and diverse as the fruit and the bloom on the bramble. It goes without speaking.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000369.wav|These differences are precisely what might have been expected from the union of Squire Hamley with the town-bred, refined, delicate-minded woman whom he married;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000370.wav|and the affection of the young men, their kindness to use the word in its old and new meanings at once is nothing but a reproduction of those impalpable threads of love
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000371.wav|which bound the equally diverse father and mother in bonds faster than the ties of blood.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000372.wav|But we will not permit ourselves to write any more in this vein.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000373.wav|It is unnecessary to demonstrate to those who know what is and what is not true literature that Missis Gaskell was gifted with some of the choicest faculties bestowed upon mankind;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000374.wav|that these grew into greater strength and ripened into greater beauty in the decline of her days;
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000375.wav|and that she has gifted us with some of the truest, purest works of fiction in the language.
eng_uk/wavs/wives_and_daughters_60_f000376.wav|And she was herself what her works show her to have been - a wise, good woman.
